**RECOMMENDATIONS**

Channels should analyze why engagement dropped in the 2020s and adopt formats or strategies that resonated in the 2010s. Leveraging social media and engaging with viewers through live streams or interactive content might help regain momentum.

Emerging channels can study MrBeast’s and T-Series’ engagement tactics, like frequent uploads, high-quality production, and viewer interaction, to grow their subscriber base.

New creators should explore less saturated categories to stand out or create hybrid content that combines aspects of popular categories with unique topics.

Channels could invest in high-quality series or create a storyline across episodes to keep viewers engaged and looking forward to new content.
